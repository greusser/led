# 0.4.0-beta


 - **Selection**: you can now select any element in a level by using `ALT` + left click. You can move it around by holding left click. To select a **rectangle area**, use `ALT` + `SHIFT` + left click.
 - **Duplicate**: you can duplicate any element in the level by drag it with `CTRL`+`ALT` keys.

    **NOTE: For now, "undoing" a *selection move* will require multiple Undos: one per affected layer.** Undo/Redo features need a *major* rework, but this will only happen in a future update (see [#151](https://github.com/deepnight/led/issues/151)). Sorry for the inconvenience!

 - Renamed the old *Enhance active layer* option to **Single layer mode**
 - `Alt`+`left click` now picks elements in *all* layers. If you have the *Single layer mode* activated (`A` key), it will make a smarter choice than before, and prioritize current layer. TLDR; you should always pick what is expected with this action.
 - Added an option to allow selection of empty spaces
 - Use `DELETE` key to delete selected elements
 - Use `CTRL`+`A` shortcut to select everything (limited to current layer in *Single Layer Mode*).
 - Added the up-to-date *JSON format doc* to the app Home page.
 - Added fullscreen button to view Home *changelogs*
 - Pressing `ENTER` on the Home screen now opens last edited map.
 - Removed duplicate sample map
 - Fixed "color" field size in Entity instance editor when the value wasn't default.
 - Updated help window
 - Many bug fixes

# 0.3.2-beta

 - Fixed a crash when resizing level with an Entity having a null Point value
 - Added button icons in Help window

# 0.3.1-beta

 - **Tiled (TMX) export option**: from the project settings (`F1`), check the *Tiled export* option to save Tiled compatible files along with the LEd JSON.

    **DISCLAIMER**: this export is limited because Tiled doesn't support some core features from LEd, like different grid sizes in the same level or Array of properties in Entities. This export is only meant as a short-term solution to quickly load LEd data in a framework only supporting TMX files. See [documentation](https://deepnight.net/docs/led/json/tiled/) for more informations.

 - Better active/inactive visual state for rules and groups of rules in auto-layers
 - Inactive rules are no longer exported in the JSON file
 - Pressing `F` key twice fits the current level in view but with less padding
 - Added an automated JSON format documentation generator (see [JSON_DOC.md](https://github.com/deepnight/led/blob/master/JSON_DOC.md) in sources)
 - Added version badges in the JSON doc to quickly identify changes per versions.
 - Updated home page
 - Updated `sample` maps

# 0.3.0-beta

 - **Group of tiles in auto-layer rules**: this new feature allows you to place larger objects (eg. *a tree, a big rock, etc.*) made of multiple tiles using just auto-layer rules.
 - Added **Modulo** options for auto-layer rules: this allows a rule to only apply every X columns or Y rows.
 - Added **Checker mode** for auto-layer rules: this makes effects like "brick walls" or "Sonic checker effect" possible ;)
 - **Better hot-reloading**: when a tileset images changes on the disk, LEd will automatically remap tile coordinates if the image size changes. This feature now also works to remap auto-layer tiles.
 - **JSON changes**: please check the new [JSON_CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/deepnight/led/blob/master/JSON_CHANGELOG.md) for up-to-date changes to JSON format.
 - Fixed image import that failed if the image file was standing on a different drive than the project file.
 - Fixed rule `random` function giving identical results for different rules
 - Fixed a crash while editing rules in *pure* auto-layers.
 - Fixed a crash when Undo history reaches its max (might need more rework).
 - Prepared support for Mac & Linux versions
 - Minor fixes for Linux builds
 - Updated `Samples`
 - Bug fixes


# 0.2.1-beta

 - Added `F1`-`F6` key shortcuts for all editor panels
 - Updated JSON file format with some extra dev-friendly values
 - Added a JSON changelog file for devs working on importers
 - Add JSON changelog to app start page

# 0.2.0-beta

 - **Beta version!**: LEd is now stable enough to be used in production and retro-compatibility will be guaranteed from now on.
 - **Radius**: Integer and Float entity fields can now be displayed as a radius around the entity (eg. a "lightRadius" Float value can now be displayed accordingly right in the editor display). See `Samples` for some examples.
 - **Smart color use**: if you have a Color field in an entity, it will be used when displaying various values in the editor (eg. having a "lightColor" field will affect the color of the circle around the entity).
 - Added support for **tile spacing** and **padding** in Tilesets images.
 - Entity **Arrays** can now be sorted manually
 - Entity tiles can now be displayed as "stretched" (default) or "cropped".
 - A preview of the "Perlin noise" is displayed while editing the settings of an auto-layer rule perlin.
 - Added **mouse coords** in the bottom-right corner of the window.
 - Updated appearance of selected entities
 - Added a field display option to use Enum tiles in place of Entity tiles
 - Added a new option for entities with count limits ("move last one instead of adding").
 - "Enhance active layer" option is now false by default (press `A` to toggle)
 - Entities can now be displayed as "Crosses"
 - Various UI fixes in "Compact" mode (when pressing `TAB`)
 - Fixed relative paths remapping when "Saving As" project
 - Fixed level resize issues which moved Entities and their Point fields in a strange way
 - Fixed panels/windows not closing during app update
 - Fixed SaveAs shortcut (`CTRL+SHIFT+S`)
 - Better entity tile picking UI
 - Updated `Samples`
 - Bug fixes

# 0.1.7-alpha

 - **Array of entity fields**: any field type in an Entity can now be an Array. For example, you could have an Array of Enums to represent the items hidden inside a Cratebox entity. See `Samples` for some examples.
 - **Point coordinates & paths**: this new entity field type allows you to pick a grid coordinates. And if you combine this with the new Array support, you can even build paths of points! See `Samples` for some examples.
 - Added a confirmation when trying to update the app while having unsaved changes
 - UI tweaks & fixes
 - Added some click tolerance when picking entities
 - Swapped "Tileset" and "Enum" buttons in main toolbar
 - Fixed an infinite loop on undo/redo in some levels
 - Updated Haxe API
 - Bug fixes

# 0.1.6-alpha

 - **"Pure" auto-layers**: these layers only have rules and use a separate IntGrid layer as source for their value checks. Very useful to have a separate auto-layer that contains drop-shadows of walls, for example. You can have any number of pure auto-layers using the same single IntGrid source.
 - Grid lock (formerly grid snap) now uses `L` key shortcut instead of G
 - Grid visibility can be toggled using `G` key shortcut
 - Added `SHIFT-R` shortcut to show/hide all auto-layers
 - Updated sample projects
 - Updated "help" window
 - Added quick notifications for some user actions
 - Fixed render issues when deleting or updating auto-layer rules
 - Fixed Haxe API issues
 - Fixed bugs
 - Added some internal app logging for debugging purpose (no sensitive data, don't worry)

# 0.1.5-alpha

 - **Auto-layers**: IntGrid layers can now render themselves automatically by drawing tiles based on their content. You can create "patterns of IntGrid values" (called **Rules**) to decide when a specific tile, or group of random tiles, should appear. It can for example be used to:
   - add random grass or rocks on top of platforms,
   - add random ceiling props under platforms,
   - render ground/water/lava area,
   - etc.
 - Auto-layer rules can be organized in groups.
 - *`Samples`*: click on the `Samples` button on home page to load some example projects.
 - **Smarter warning** when deleting something in a panel. ie. If the value you're removing isn't actually used in your project, you will get a "softer" warning.
 - **Large levels optimizations**: started an important rework of the way levels are rendered on-screen to make room for future optimizations on large levels. For now, it's still recommended to work on levels with smaller dimensions.
 - Added a project option to minify the JSON file.
 - Smarter extern Enum sync: the removal of unused enums will be shown as low-risks operations.
 - Added perlin noise support to Auto-layers rules (a rule can apply to only a random area).
 - Changed version number to 0.1.x because no one could stop me from doing it
 - Better element sorting (levels, layers etc.) experience using SortableJS lib
 - Closing a panel with a color picker will now validate color before closing the panel.
 - Better viewport centering when opening a level.
 - Fixed `0-9` keyboard shortcuts while focusing a field
 - Fixed save/load notifications
 - Many UI/UX fixes
 - Bug fixes
